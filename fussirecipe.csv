Trust me, this recipe will become your go-to oven roasted chicken recip",Indian,Main course,165 & 4,Non Veg,15 minutes,60 minutes,"1kg chicken include salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and herbs","Selecting the Chicken: Choose a fresh whole chicken of desired size, typically 3-5 pounds (1.4-2.3 kg), depending on the number of servings needed.Cleaning and Patting Dry: Remove any giblets from the cavity of the chicken. Rinse the chicken under cold water, inside and out, and pat it dry with paper towels. This helps to ensure crispy skin during roasting.Seasoning: Rub the chicken inside and out with seasoning of your choice. Common seasonings include salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and herbs like thyme, rosemary, or sage. You can also add a bit of olive oil or melted butter for extra flavor and moisture.Trussing (Optional): Trussing involves tying the legs and wings of the chicken close to the body to promote even cooking. While it's optional, trussing can help the chicken maintain its shape and cook more evenly.Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
Cooking:Roasting: Place the seasoned and trussed (if desired) chicken breast-side up on a roasting pan or baking dish. You can also add vegetables like carrots, potatoes, and onions around the chicken for a complete meal. Roast the chicken in the preheated oven.
Cooking Time: The cooking time will vary depending on the size of the chicken. As a general guideline, roast the chicken for about 20 minutes per pound (450 g). Use a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken (not touching bone) to ensure it reaches an internal temperature of at least 165°F (74°C).Basting (Optional): Some people like to baste the chicken with its own juices or a mixture of melted butter and herbs during the cooking process to keep it moist.Resting: Once the chicken is cooked through, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a juicier bird.",641

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Divide the rested dough into 6 equal portions and roll each portion into a ball. Roll out each ball into a thin circle, about 6 inches in diameter.Cut each circle in half to form semi-circles. Take one semi-circle and fold it into a cone shape, sealing the edges with a little water.Fill the cone with a spoonful of the cooled beef mixture, then seal the open edge of the cone with water, pressing firmly to ensure it's tightly sealed.Repeat with the remaining dough and filling to make more samosas.Place the samosas on the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops lightly with oil.Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the samosas are golden brown and crispy.",1151
